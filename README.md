# Pedestrian Simulation - Java course HT17
This is a project assignment for the Java course 'Java for interface and networking' at Ã–rebro university.

# Update 1:
*At the beginning, I have been struggling with the animation of some figures and how to update their positions.
*It seems that lots of for-loops are needed to iterate through all the agents that I create.
*Perhaps by implementing my AgentUpdater class to a container class may solve several issues.
